# EdgeOS
Web-based operating system with Microsoft Edge as its core - Inspired on the recent leaks involving EdgeOS but not related with that in any way

Based on Windows 11 21H2 version 22000.132

# Features included

Web App Store makes it easier to find your favorite sites and install them as 

# Planning to

Make a Linux-based version 

All rights goes to Microsoft Corporation. I do not own Edge or Windows, this is just for test and educational purposes, and kinda for my fun
